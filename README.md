# MMORPG
This repo is created for the Pokemon MMORPG

The project contains an frontend client application and an backend server application.
The connection between both is made with sockets, information exchange happens with the PrintWriter and the Scanner.

When the Backend is started, the fontend application can be run. This will startup up de GUI.

While starting up the JFrame, the connection between both will be set up via the "/connect" commando.

The Gui has the GameStateController which controls the currently drawn interface.
